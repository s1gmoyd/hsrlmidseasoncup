Text descriptions of a configuration file can be put at the top of the file.
The configuration begins with a line that only says "begin config".
Don't put anything beneath the team names as that'll probably break the mod.
Separate all values with commas. If a team has a space in the name, just put a comma after the whole name.
You can leave out colors, but you can't skip colors.
    i.e. You can have just Home and Away, but you can't have just Home and Alternate. Alternate would become Away.

Team name      Home Colors               Away Colors               Alternate Colors
